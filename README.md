## üìò Description

This notebook was designed to be self-explanatory and should be read in conjunction with the associated monograph/paper. The program is specifically designed for nitrogen gas plasmas (N‚ÇÇ), focusing on the Second Positive System of the neutral nitrogen molecule (N‚ÇÇ) and the First Negative System of the molecular ion (N‚ÇÇ‚Å∫). Other electronic transitions or species have not been tested.

## üìÅ Required Files (for testing purposes)

Make sure the following files are in the same directory as the notebook to ensure correct functionality:

- `100mA.txt` ‚Äî Spectroscopic data file containing intensity vs. wavelength (nm). You may replace this with other experimental spectra.
- `RxTe.dat` ‚Äî File containing Andr√© Ricard‚Äôs plot of Ratio vs. Electron Temperature.  **‚ö†Ô∏è Do not modify this file.**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Execution (optional)

If you wish to run the notebook locally:

1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Then, launch the notebook with:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Spectroscopic_Method.ipynb
